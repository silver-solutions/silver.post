silver.post Extension for eZ Publish
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

silver.post extends the ezprestapiprovider Extension by means
to publish new articles via the REST interface.

silver.post depends on the ezprestapiprovider extension which comes
with eZ Publish since version 4.5.0.
Sourcecode: https://github.com/ezsystems/ezprestapiprovider/




INSTALLATION
============

Follow these steps to add the silver.post Extension to your eZ publish installation:

  1) Extract the archive into the /extension directory

  2) Edit site.ini.append in /settings/override. Add the following to the file:

       [ExtensionSettings]
       ActiveExtensions[]=silver.post

     (if you already have the [ExtensionSettings] block, just add the second line)

     Alternatively activate the extension via the Admin interface.

  3) Update the autoloader definitions by running the following command:

       php bin/php/ezpgenerateautoloads.php -e -p

  4) Clear Cache




USAGE
=====

After enabling the extension, there are 3 new REST methods available:


> http://example.org/api/ssr/v1/status

Just returns a variables "status" with the value "OK". To check for connection and reachability.


> http://example.org/api/ssr/v1/content/getallowednodes

Returns "status" = "OK" and an array "allowed_nodes" which contains Node ID => Title from the
silver.post.ini file. The number of entries in that array can be found in "allowed_nodes_count".


> http://example.org/api/ssr/v1/content/addchild/<Node-Id>     (Replace <Node-Id> with the actual Node-ID.)

Publishs a new "article" object below Node <Node-Id>. Please make sure the specific user
has the appropriate permissions! You have to send a few parameters:

  - "headline" : The article title.
  - "teaser" : The intro text.
  - "text" : The main body text.
  - "image" (File-Upload, optional)

The method will return the following values:

  - "status" : "OK" if everything went fine, "ERROR" on error

The following variables are only returned if "status" was "OK".
  - "contentobject_id" : ContentObject-ID of the new article
  - "main_node_id" : Main Node-ID of the new article
  - "url_alias" : URL-Alias of the new article
  - "url" : Full URL of the new article
